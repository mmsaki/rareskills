# week 6

- [ ] Create a contract with a function `checkSudoku` that accepts a sudoku and verifies it.

- [ ] Fuzz your contract with [Woke Fuzzer](https://ackeeblockchain.com/woke/docs/latest/testing-framework/fuzzing/)

  - [ ] Fallback if it's too hard: Write unit tests

> **Note**: We haven't discussed fuzzing yet, but once we do there will be a lot to cover in a short period of time, so you need to have already tried it.
